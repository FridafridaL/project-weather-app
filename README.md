# Weather App

We were asked to work in pairs and to build a weather app and using branches. 
we learned about using fetch functions in javascript and to get data from an API.


## The problem
we have googled, using stack overflow and chat gpt so solve our problems. 
we started to build  the  foundation of our app using liveshare in vs code and then split up in branches. We did one part each of the task and then merged och branches. 
we used promises, fetch functions, json and http-methods to put the project together.

If we had more time we whould try to do the stretchgoals and add more cities to the app.
We also whould make the search-button work.
